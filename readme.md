#### React Bar

The idea of Reactbar is to use multitouch interaction and tangible
interface for entertainment in public spaces, exploring the concept
of social networking. It has a simple and intuitive interface,
in a fun use experience. It promotes a real interaction among users,
starting it in a virtual way.

The user receives a glass coaster, which will be the tangible element
for the interaction. On the i.Table, it is possible to access service
options, like drink selection and bill checking. The user can, also,
see and edit his profile - including his mood, represented by a color
under the coaster - and interact with other people through a map.

This interaction is restricted to mark other people, offer them a drink
or send them short messages - it is just a good excuse to meet
personally, in real life.
